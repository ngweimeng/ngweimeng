## Two Truths One Lie

## About Me

Hi there! I'm Wei Meng, a Singaporean student pursuing a MSc in Big Data and Business Analytics at ESCP Business School (Paris & Berlin Campus). An avid learner, tech aficionado, and unabashed coffee lover, I get a kick from solving meaningful problems with data and technology while having fun along the way. Beyond the classroom, I enjoy scuba diving (PADI-certified rescue diver), trail running, and engaging in spirited discussions about coffee brewing techniques (V60 pour over, no sugar please).

Prior to embarking on my academic journey, I proudly served as a Naval Officer in the Singapore Armed Forces where I stood guard over my nation's sovereign waters. Though I have since transitioned from active service, I remain thankful to the Navy for the invaluable opportunities it provided to make a difference in my nationâ€™s maritime journey.

General FiÃ©vetâ€™s book, "De la stratÃ©gie militaire Ã  la stratÃ©gie dâ€™entreprise," brilliantly outlines the nexus between military strategy and business strategy: a creative and coherent strategy in both contexts is vital to face an uncertain future and achieve set objectives with limited resources. In that connection, I aspire to merge my experience in military decision-making with my interests in big data to solve problems in the business world.

As a firm believer in learning through hands-on practice, I frequently tinker on personal projects to reinforce my knowledge. You can find them below.
